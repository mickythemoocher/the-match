<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF">Come on now you two brutes. Let's be having you in the ring.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alice:</font color="#0000FF"> (to Hammerhead) You are fighting fit today Hammerhead. Are you ready for this big match?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> Hmm, I guess so<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alice: </font color="#0000FF"> (A little angry)You guess so? You guess so? Hammerhead this is the most important night of your life. You just have to win.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> ( A little disinterested) I just kind of wish it was tomorrow instead.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alice:</font color="#0000FF"> Well it isn't tomorrow it is tonight, so get yourself into a fighting mood.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> So ladies and gentlemen, in the blue corner we have your own, your very own Bruuuuuissser.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, into that ring and look sharp.<p>
(There are cheers and boo's from the crowd as Bruiser climbs into the ring)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> And in the red corner, all the way from the other side of town we have the mighty man himself Haaaaaaaaaammmmmerhead.<p>
(More cheers and boo's from the crowd as Hammerhead joins Bruiser in the ring)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> There will be 10, three minute rounds, so touch gloves gentlemen and let the boxing begin.<p>
(There is a moment or two of silence).<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> Come on you two let the fight begin, start boxing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Do you want to punch me first or shall I punch you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> I don't mind really, which do you prefer?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> I think I usually let the other chap have the first punch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> Aww that makes me feel a bit mean, punching you when you haven't punched me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes I think I would feel the same.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> I have an idea, why don't we try to do it both at the same time?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF">Oh yes! That is a brilliant idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF">  Will you two please start fighting.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser and Hammer head together:</font color="#0000FF"> We are trying to.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> Well get on with it then.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> We were trying to decide who goes first.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> (Astonished)Who goes first? Who goes first? This is a boxing match not a game of Trivial Pursuits. Now get on with it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> Shall we count to three then have a punch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, Will you count or shall I<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> I am quite happy for you to count.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alice:</font color="#0000FF"> (Loudly) Hammerhead will you start boxing, you are wasting time you will never knock him out like that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> Shhh Alice we are just about to start.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alice:</font color="#0000FF"> About time too!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok I'll count then shall I?<p>

(There is laughter from both Bruiser and Hammer head)<p><font size="4">
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh I am sorry Bruiser I missed completely.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, so did I. I feel such a fool.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"></font color="#0000FF"> Me too.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Shall we try it again?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> (exasperated) This is the very, very worst boxing match I have ever experienced. Will one of you please throw a punch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF">  Be quiet referee, you are putting us off.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> Well get on with it then.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom: </font color="#0000FF">(Loudly) Bruiser, You should be boxing. You look like you are out for a Sunday afternoon stroll.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> We are going to be Boxing, just be patient.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> Anyone would think you two had never boxed in your life<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> You count this time Hammerhead<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok. one – two..... Oh can I just say something?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> I really like your shorts<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh thanks. They are new, this is the fist time I have worn them.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> I thought they looked new, Can I ask where you bought them.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> (Whispers) Primark, don't tell anyone though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Your secret is safe with me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Referee:</font color="#0000FF"> Please, for goodness sake box?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> I can't see the sense in paying a lot of money at a sports shop when Primark is so much cheaper.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes you are right, these gloves cost a fortune<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Oh, don't talk to me about gloves. They are about twice the price they were last year.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> And the quality is not so good.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> (Loudly) Bruiser if you don't start boxing soon I will resign.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> Don't be silly Tom, we are going to box, just having a little chat first.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> You are supposed to be punching him, not chatting to him.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Bruiser:</font color="#0000FF"> That seems very rude to me Tom, to start punching him in the middle of a conversation<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> You are not supposed to be in a conversation, you are supposed to be boxing.<p>
 ( A bell rings)<p>

<font color="#0000FF"> Hammerhead:</font color="#0000FF"> I disagree Alice I thought we were both very polite.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alice:</font color="#0000FF"> That is the problem. You are not supposed to be polite, you are supposed to knocking him for six.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Tom:</font color="#0000FF"> This is round two Bruiser so I want to see some big changes. For Goodness sake, start boxing.<p>
